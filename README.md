# TJ-OSINT-Notebook

## Intial Release
November 18th 2022

## Main Purpose: 
This OSINT Notebook provides an overview of the tools, techniques, and resources that I use for a variety of situations for performing reconaissance and OSINT operations. This Notebook has helped me in many situations to learn more about OSINT and how to analyze the data that is out there on the internet. Included in the notebook are three templates that you can copy, fill in, or repurpose depending on the information you need to document for the operations you are working on. These case templates helped me keep a track of things I found online depending on the situation that I was assigned to assess.

## A word of Advice:

Although this notebook may be missing a tool, resource, or technique that other OSINT operators use, it is really hard to keep a track of what is out there. There will always be a new tool, search technique, or resource telling you how to OSINT.
At the end of the day you should use this notebook as a way to start a baseline to create your own or to modify it for your use cases and situations.
